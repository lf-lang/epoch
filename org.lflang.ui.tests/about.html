    <h2>About This Content</h2>
    <!-- 
         The about.html file should contain legal documentation.

         Every plug-in and fragment should have an about.html file so 
         that it is possible to download this plug-in, compose
         a custom runtime consisting of multiple features and preserve
         the licensing.

         Under macOS, this content is visible via 
         Eclipse -> About Eclipse -> Installation Details -> Plug-ins

         For Lingua Franca, the about.html file should probably be the
         same for all the Lingua Franca products to make it easy to update.
